# AJP-ICA2

We were tasked as a group with creating a piece of middleware using Java, for an assessment at University.

## objectives
•	the middleware will support mixed networks of portals and user defined agents (also allowing for future extensibility)

•	networks will be structured as interlaced trees with uni- and bi-directional links

•	where appropriate the middleware will allow nodes to be scoped (up to and below named nodes in their hierarchies

•	the software will include hooks for node monitors and at least one implementation of NodeMonitor

•	the software will support (at least) two message types (i) UsrMsg to encapsulate messages between user agents (ii) SystemMsg to wrap messages between meta-agents detailing agent registration requests and other admin functions

•	all aspects of software design/construction will (i) make best use of appropriate design patterns (ii) support scalability and (iii) use designs which support future extensibility.
